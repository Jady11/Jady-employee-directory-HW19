## EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY

## User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Installation
    Initial installation using `create-react-app`.  Followed up with `axios`, `react-router-dom` and `bootstrap`.

    Open terminal and run `npm start`. Once react has successfully compiled, the page automatically opens in `localhost:3000` and from there the user can search for employee information through data rendered through a random employee API.
